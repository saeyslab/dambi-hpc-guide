# Frameworks

Instead of running your code or shell scripts directly on the HPC, it can be easier to use a higher-level framework to handle the job submissions for you. We can organize them by language support:

## Multi-language

You can use any language in any framework by calling a script, but some frameworks make it much more convenient and allow you to set the execution environment.

### Nextflow

Any script

### Apache Spark

Python/Java/R

### Apache Airflow

Any script


## Python
- Dask
    - very easy to get started and great ecosystem (numpy, pandas, xarray, SpatialData...)
- Ray
