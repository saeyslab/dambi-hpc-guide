# Welcome to the DaMBi HPC Guide

This is a collection of best-practices in High-Performance Computing for Bioinformatics. While generally applicable, some information is specific to the [UGent HPC infrastructure](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en/infrastructure).

```{important}
Be sure to read [Chapter 1 to 3 of the UGent HPC guide](https://www.ugent.be/hpc/en/support/documentation.htm) first, as this will allow you to connect to the HPC!
```

The guide material builds up in three levels:

1. **Beginner**: interactive sessions (RStudio, Jupyter Notebook) via *Open OnDemand*
    - for **any user** in need of large data storage or computational resources 
2. **Intermediate**: running jobs 
    - for **bioinformaticians** with long-running pipelines or multiple datasets
3. **Advanced**: advanced topics like acceleration, frameworks and more
    - for **experienced HPC users**
